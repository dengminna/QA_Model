# MPCNN-sentence-similarity-tensorflow
this is the tensorflow code of the paper:"Multi-Perspective Sentence Similarity Modeling with Convolution Neural Networks." &&
“UMD-TTIC-UW at SemEval-2016 Task 1: Attention-Based Multi-Perspective Convolutional Neural Networks for Textual Similarity 
Measurement”

to run, you should have python2.7 and tensorflow 1.0
what's more, you should download the glove word2vec file:
http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

also you can watch my blog of this, there are test result in the third blog. but the acc is not good, about 70%, it need to be improved:
